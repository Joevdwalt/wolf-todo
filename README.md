# Overview

This app is a todo manager that saves files in markdown files. The todo's are markdown todo files

## Structure

main
|__ src (source code)

## Prerequisites

Maintainers need the following tools before working on the project:

- [.NET 10 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/10.0) for building
  and running the application.
- [PowerShell](https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/) for repository scripts.
- [Task](https://taskfile.dev/) for running the tasks defined in `TaskFile.yml`.

Verify the tools are available:

```text
dotnet --version
pwsh --version
task --version
```

## Development Workflow

Run repository automation through named tasks declared in `TaskFile.yml`.
This includes build, test, formatting, linting, generation, and maintenance
operations. Do not use repository scripts directly as the normal workflow.

## Running the TUI

Create the global `config.toml` before starting the TUI:

- Linux: `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/wtodo/config.toml`, or
  `~/.config/wtodo/config.toml` when `XDG_CONFIG_HOME` is unset.
- macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/wtodo/config.toml`.
- Windows: `%APPDATA%\wtodo\config.toml`.

```toml
[projects]
files = [
  "/absolute/path/to/project-one.md",
  "/absolute/path/to/project-two.md"
]

[keybindings]
quit = ":q"
```

Each configured Markdown file is one project. Start the application with:

```text
task run-tui
```
